# Fan Mount

This oscilloscope has a large AC fan in the rear for cooling.

As this scope was manufactured is `1959` and is not in the best condition, the rubber bushings on the fan mount have long sense dry rotted.

To replace these mounts, I have taken three M3 x `20` with small nuts and put them in place of the bushings.

I placed the screw through the hole from the bushings and tightened two nuts on the end, into each-other to secure the fan in position.

Note ** each screw must be tightened gradually to ensure the fan stays centered.
